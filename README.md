# Face_Mask_Detection_System
This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using computer vision techniques. 
A custom CNN-based feature extractor is implemented manually using convolution, ReLU, and pooling operations without using deep learning libraries or backpropagation. 
OpenCV is used only for image preprocessing and face ROI extraction, while classification is performed using simple rule-based logic on extracted features.
